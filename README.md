# Probabilistic-Graphical-Models

Numerous large-scale projects and prominent financial institutions focus
 on predicting financial markets using advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
 Machine Learning (ML) approach, leading to publicly available stock indices data
 sets. In this report, we will model, integrate the financial market movements using

 This probabilistic approach incorporating a wide range of external factors that
 influence market behavior, such as macroeconomic trends, economic indicators,
 geopolitical events, technical indicators, regional and sector-specific develop
